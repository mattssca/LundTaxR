Description: LundTaxR implements a robust Random Forest-based classifier for molecular subtyping of 
    bladder cancer samples using gene expression data. The package provides a two-stage classification 
    system that first assigns samples to one of five main Lund Taxonomy subtypes (Uro, GU, BaSq, Mes, 
    or ScNE), followed by sub-classification of Uro samples into UroA, UroB, or UroC subtypes. Beyond 
    classification, the package calculates comprehensive molecular signature scores including immune 
    infiltration, stromal content, cell proliferation, and progression risk markers. Advanced 
    visualization functions generate publication-ready heatmaps displaying classification results 
    alongside molecular signatures, pathway activities, and clinical risk assessments. The classifier 
    supports both HGNC symbols and Ensembl gene IDs, includes robust imputation methods for missing 
    data, and provides confidence scores for all predictions. Originally developed for the Lund 
    Taxonomy molecular classification system, this package enables researchers and clinicians to 
    perform standardized, reproducible molecular subtyping of bladder cancer samples for precision 
    medicine applications.
