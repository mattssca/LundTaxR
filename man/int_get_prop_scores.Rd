\usage{
int_get_prop_scores(these_predictions = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{these_predictions}{A list containing a data frame named \code{scores} with prediction scores.
The data frame should have row names as sample IDs and columns corresponding to different cell
types and scores.}
}
\value{
A data frame with the original scores, normalized scores, and the calculated
immune/stroma ratio. The row names are the sample IDs.
}
\description{
Internal function called by \code{plot_hm_scores} when \code{proportional_scores = TRUE}.
Not meant for out-of-package usage.
}
